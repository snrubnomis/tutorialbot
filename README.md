# Tutorial Bot - IBM Watson Conversation sample

This application demonstrates an event-based proactive chat bot built using Watson Conversation.

Watson Conversation is a service that runs on Bluemix (IBM's cloud development platform).  You can create your own instance and train it to understand and respond to your own domain.

This bot consists of 3 parts: the front-end (which runs in your browser), the backend (which provides the front-end with an API to call), and the Watson Conversation service.
